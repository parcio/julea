# Debugging

There are several ways to debug JULEA.
Moreover, developers should be aware of the fact that debug builds of JULEA can behave differently than release builds:
1. The `JULEA_BACKEND_PATH` environment variable can be used to override JULEA's internal backend path only in debug builds.
2. Tracing via `JULEA_TRACE` is only available in debug builds.

## Tracing

JULEA contains a tracing component that can be used to record information about various aspects of JULEA's behavior.
The overall tracing can be influenced using the `JULEA_TRACE` environment variable.
If the variable is set to `echo`, all tracing information will be printed to stderr.
If the variable is set to `summary`, the runtime and calls are added for each unique call stack.
If JULEA has been built with OTF support, a value of `otf` will cause JULEA to produce traces via OTF.
It is also possible to specify multiple values separated by commas.

By default, all functions are traced.
If this produces too much output, a filter can be set using the `JULEA_TRACE_FUNCTION` environment variable.
The variable can contain a list of function matcher that are separated by commas.
The wildcards support `*` and `?`.
Filterung will remove call stacks from the `summary`,
to keep the call stack do differ between different kind you can specify `KEEP_STACK` as matcher.
You can also add matcher for top level functions you are interested in.

## Coverage

Generating a coverage report requires the `gcovr` tool to be installed.
If it is not available on your system, you can install it as an [additional dependency](dependencies.md#additional-dependencies).
The following steps set up everything to generate a coverage report:

```console
$ . scripts/environment.sh
$ spack install py-gcovr
$ spack load py-gcovr
$ meson setup -Db_coverage=true bld
$ ninja -C bld
$ ./scripts/setup.sh start
$ ./scripts/test.sh
$ ./scripts/setup.sh stop
$ ninja -C bld coverage
```
